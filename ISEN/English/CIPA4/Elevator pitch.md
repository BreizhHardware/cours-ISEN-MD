Hello,
I just see your presentation about the rise of cloud technology in enterprise. I find your point of vue very interesting. I'm currently seeking for an internship can I take a moment to introduce me ?
My name is Félix MARQUET, I'm a 21 years old french engineering student passionate about cybersecurity and development. 
I'm currently in fourth-year engineering at the Institut Supérieur de l’Électronique et du Numérique in France, specializing in cybersecurity and development. I'm expected to be graduated in Septembre 2027.
I'm in apprenticeship at Horoquartz, a french company that create Human Ressources software, as a Full-Stack developer. During this apprenticeship I developed an automated update system for the eTemptation product, honing my skills in API development, database management, and scalable infrastructure design.
I think I can contribute to your team’s mission of empowering organizations through innovative data infrastructure. At Horoquartz I have to deploy my solution to Azure Cloud so the rise of cloud technology have a direct impact on me. I found this subject really interesting and passionated.
Thank you for taking the time to listen me, and don't forget, I'm Félix MARQUET and you will here about me.
