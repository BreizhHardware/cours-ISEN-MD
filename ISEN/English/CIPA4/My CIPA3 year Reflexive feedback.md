FÃ©lix MARQUET - Horoquartz

I work as a backend developer on my own project, focused on building an update system for Horoquartz products. My role involves designing a reliable, secure, and scalable infrastructure to deliver software and firmware updates. My daily tasks include developing APIs, managing databases, and collaborating with other teams to ensure seamless integration and user experience but this part will only start this year.
My first year as an apprentice was overwhelmingly positive. It gave me the opportunity to see how a company operates and taught me how to structure projects and write clean, maintainable, reliable code. I think working in a professional environment proved far more educational than classroom learning alone. For instance, I had no prior experience with Go (a programming language), but through practice on a real project, I now feel I have partially mastered the language.
This year I want to improve my communication skill, not only when it's about animating a meeting but also when speaking with the colleague. Because during this year due to the fact that I have worked on a brand new project, I haven't the occasion to work with other team, which lead me to not know a lot of people.
